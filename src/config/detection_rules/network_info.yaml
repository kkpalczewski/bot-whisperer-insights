    Network fingerprinting system analyzing connection properties, WebRTC capabilities, and timing metrics.
    RTT (Round-Trip Time) measures network latency in milliseconds, critical for connection quality assessment.
    WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) is a browser API enabling peer-to-peer communication, often used for IP leak detection.
    The system performs comprehensive analysis of network characteristics including connection type classification (4G, 3G, slow-2g),
    bandwidth capacity in Mbps (Megabits per second), and timing metrics for page load performance.

      RTT consistently below 10ms indicates datacenter-like latency, impossible for residential connections (expected: 20-100ms).

      Page load times consistently below 500ms (unrealistic for human users, expected: 1000-5000ms) indicate automation.
      Connection type claiming 4G with latency below 15ms (physically impossible for mobile networks) suggests spoofed information.
