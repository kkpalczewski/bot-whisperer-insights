    Advanced browser fingerprinting and automation detection system implementing comprehensive API inspection and behavioral analysis.
    The system performs sophisticated analysis of browser characteristics (navigator.userAgent, navigator.platform),
    feature support (Notification, Geolocation, WebGL), and automation framework artifacts (navigator.webdriver, window._phantom).
    Key detection methods include:
    1) Sophisticated automation framework detection through property existence checks (in operator) and runtime configuration analysis
    2) Comprehensive permission state verification using the in operator and API availability checks (Notification.permission)
    3) Hardware characteristic analysis through navigator properties (deviceMemory, hardwareConcurrency) and capability detection
    4) Feature support verification with error handling (try-catch) and fallback mechanisms
    5) Plugin enumeration and analysis through Array.from(navigator.plugins) with property extraction (name, description, filename)
    6) Timezone and language preference analysis (Intl.DateTimeFormat, navigator.languages) for behavioral fingerprinting
    All checks are performed synchronously in the main thread to prevent timing-based evasion techniques and ensure reliable detection.

      Automated environments typically exhibit specific patterns that differ from legitimate browsers.
      The presence of navigator.webdriver = true combined with Notification.permission = 'not_supported' indicates Selenium automation.
      Detection of window._phantom = true with navigator.plugins.length = 0 confirms PhantomJS environment.
      ChromeDP automation is indicated by chrome.app.isInstalled = true without chrome.runtime availability.
      Hardware characteristics showing hardwareConcurrency = 1 with deviceMemory = 0 suggest virtualized environment.
      Missing WebGL support (canvas.getContext('webgl')) combined with navigator.webdriver = true confirms Selenium automation with limited capabilities.
