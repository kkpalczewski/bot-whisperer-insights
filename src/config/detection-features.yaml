detectionFeatures:
  - id: user-agent
    name: User Agent
    code: navigator.userAgent

    category: browser
    
  - id: languages
    name: Browser Languages

  - id: webgl
    name: WebGL Fingerprint
    code: "const canvas = document.createElement('canvas'); const gl = canvas.getContext('webgl'); gl?.getExtension('WEBGL_debug_renderer_info') ? gl.getParameter(gl.getExtension('WEBGL_debug_renderer_info').UNMASKED_RENDERER_WEBGL) : null"
    description: WebGL renderer information can identify the graphics hardware. This is difficult for bots to spoof accurately.
    category: hardware
    
  - id: canvas
    name: Canvas Fingerprint
    code: "(() => { const canvas = document.createElement('canvas'); canvas.width = 240; canvas.height = 60; const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d'); if (ctx) { ctx.fillText('BotWhisperer', 10, 50); return canvas.toDataURL(); } return null; })()"
    description: Canvas rendering varies by device and browser. The subtle differences in how text and shapes are rendered create a unique fingerprint that is hard to fake.
    category: fingerprinting
    
  - id: cpu-cores
    name: CPU Cores
    code: navigator.hardwareConcurrency || 0
    description: The number of logical processors can help identify the device type. Bots often have unrealistic or inconsistent values.
    category: hardware
    
  - id: memory
    name: Device Memory
    code: "(navigator as any).deviceMemory || 'Not available'"
    description: The amount of RAM available can help identify device capabilities. This is often spoofed or unavailable in bot environments.
    category: hardware
    
  - id: touch-support
    name: Touch Support
    code: "{ maxTouchPoints: navigator.maxTouchPoints, touchEvent: 'ontouchstart' in window, touchPoints: navigator.maxTouchPoints > 0 }"
    description: Touch capabilities can indicate device type. Inconsistencies between touch support and device type may indicate spoofing.
    category: hardware
    
  - id: connection-type
    name: Network Information
    code: "(navigator as any).connection ? { effectiveType: (navigator as any).connection.effectiveType, rtt: (navigator as any).connection.rtt } : 'Not available'"
    description: Network characteristics can help identify unusual connection patterns typical of bot networks or data centers.
    category: network
    
  - id: browser-features
    name: Browser Features
    code: "{ localStorage: !!window.localStorage, sessionStorage: !!window.sessionStorage, indexedDB: !!window.indexedDB, webWorker: !!window.Worker, webGL: !!window.WebGLRenderingContext }"
    description: Support for modern browser features can help identify outdated browsers or simplified bot environments that lack full feature sets.
    category: browser
    
  - id: audio-context
    name: Audio Context Fingerprint
    code: "(() => { try { const audioCtx = new (window.AudioContext || (window as any).webkitAudioContext)(); return { sampleRate: audioCtx.sampleRate, state: audioCtx.state, baseLatency: audioCtx.baseLatency || 'N/A' }; } catch (e) { return 'Not available'; } })()"
    description: The audio processing capabilities of a device can create a unique fingerprint. Bots typically have limited or non-standard audio capabilities.
    category: fingerprinting
    
  - id: fonts-detection
    name: System Fonts Detection
    code: "(() => { const baseFonts = ['monospace', 'sans-serif', 'serif']; const testString = 'mmMMwWLliI0O&1'; const testSize = '72px'; const h = document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0]; if (!h) return 'No body element'; const s = document.createElement('span'); s.style.fontSize = testSize; s.innerHTML = testString; const defaultWidth = {}; const defaultHeight = {}; for (const font of baseFonts) { s.style.fontFamily = font; h.appendChild(s); defaultWidth[font] = s.offsetWidth; defaultHeight[font] = s.offsetHeight; h.removeChild(s); } return { baseFonts, defaultWidth, defaultHeight }; })()"
    description: The fonts available on a system can be detected and used for fingerprinting. Bots often have limited or standard sets of fonts compared to real user devices.
    category: fingerprinting
    
  - id: navigator-permissions
    name: Permissions API
    code: "(() => { if (navigator.permissions) { return 'Permissions API available'; } return 'Permissions API not available'; })()"
    description: The Permissions API can reveal what permissions the browser has and whether it supports the modern Permissions API at all. Bots may lack this capability.
    category: browser
    
  - id: do-not-track
    name: Do Not Track Setting
    code: navigator.doNotTrack || (window as any).doNotTrack || navigator.msDoNotTrack || 'Not available'
    description: The Do Not Track setting in the browser can be used as a signal. Most users don't change this from default, so unusual patterns may indicate bot behavior.
    category: browser
    
  - id: battery-status
    name: Battery Status
    code: "(() => { if ((navigator as any).getBattery) { return 'Battery API available'; } return 'Battery API not available'; })()"
    description: Real devices have battery information. The presence of the Battery API and changing battery states can help identify real devices vs. emulated environments.
