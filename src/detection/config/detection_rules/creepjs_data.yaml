    Advanced browser fingerprinting and lie detection implementation using CreepJS library for sophisticated automation detection.
    The system performs comprehensive analysis of browser characteristics through component fingerprinting (canvas, WebGL, audio, fonts),
    behavioral pattern analysis (timing, event handling, API interaction), and consistency verification across multiple system APIs.
    Lie detection (0.0-1.0) is based on property consistency, feature support verification, and pattern recognition algorithms.
    Key detection methods include:
    1) Multi-component fingerprinting with advanced analysis of canvas rendering (2D/WebGL), audio processing (Web Audio API), font rendering (FontFace API), and WebGL capabilities
    2) Sophisticated lie detection system analyzing browser property consistency (navigator, window, document), feature support verification (API availability), and API behavior patterns
    3) Stealth technique identification through anti-fingerprinting measures (canvas blocking, WebGL spoofing), privacy-focused modifications (user agent masking), and browser hardening detection
    4) Automated bot detection using behavioral analysis (event timing, API response), property consistency checks (navigator properties), and timing-based detection (performance.now)
    5) Component-specific anomaly detection through pattern recognition (rendering artifacts) and statistical analysis (timing distributions)
    6) Error handling and fallback mechanisms for maximum reliability
    All checks are performed asynchronously with proper error handling and fallback mechanisms.

      Automated environments typically exhibit specific patterns that differ from legitimate browsers.
      A lie score above 0.7 combined with detected lies (lies.detected = true) indicates sophisticated automation.
      The presence of stealth techniques (stealth = true) alongside bot detection (bot = true) suggests automated environment.
      Inconsistent component behavior across tests, such as canvas rendering anomalies or audio processing inconsistencies, indicates potential automation.
      Missing or modified WebGL capabilities, particularly hardware acceleration markers, suggest virtualized environment.
      Limited font sets (fewer than 20 system fonts) with perfect rendering consistency indicate automated browser.
